# GitHub Code Review Extension

## Caveats

* Doesn't currently work when there are multiple pages of comments (only reads the first page).
* If one person adds +1's in separate comments, they'll be shown separately in the PR row.
* Currently only works for git.lystit.com, not Github (mostly just because I couldn't find an open project that uses +1's for PRs to test it with).
